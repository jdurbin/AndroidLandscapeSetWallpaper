This is an Android app with a simple purpose:  set wallpaper correctly in landscape orientation on the Dell Streak. 

A lot of Android apps, including the gallery app, have a portrait bias.  So, when you select a picture to set as 
your wallpaper, the crop view it shows you is the one appropriate for portrait orientation.  The wall paper looks OK in 
portrait, but seems to have the top and bottom chopped off in landscape. 

This app does one simple thing, it tells the gallery to crop with the 5:2 landscape ratio (e.g. 1600 x 480 pixels) that 
works for landscape wallpaper.   What it doesn't do is any kind of stretching or pulling of the image to make it fit.  It's
purely a crop tool.
